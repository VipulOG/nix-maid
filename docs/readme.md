Systemd + Nix dotfile management.

---

Nix-Maid allows you to configure your dotfiles and systemd services at the user level, similar to Home-Manager.

Nix-Maid is more lightweight and stays closer to the native Nix and systemd (tmpfiles) abstractions.

## Features and Design Choices

- ü™∂ Lightweight: Pushing the execution to other tools, making the project almost a pure-nix library.
- üåê Portable: Defers the value of your home directory, so the same configuration works for different users.
- üö´ No Legacy: API redesigned from scratch, avoiding past mistakes like `mkOutOfStoreSymlink`.
- ‚ö° Fast: Uses a static directory, enabling rollbacks without traversing your entire home or diffing profiles.

## Documentation

You can find the API documentation here: https://viperml.github.io/nix-maid/api

## Status

Nix-Maid should be ready to use, albeit as beta software. Only base modules are provided (linking files and running systemd units), so there is no abstraction on top of them.

Please feel free to submit abstraction modules as a Pull Request (e.g. a module that configures i3).

## Examples

Single user installation, without flakes:

```nix
# nix-maid.nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
  nix-maid = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/viperML/nix-maid/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz");
in
  nix-maid pkgs {
    packages = [
      pkgs.git
    ];
    file.home.".gitconfig".text = ''
      [user]
        name=Maid
    '';
    systemd.services."example" = {
      path = [pkgs.hello];
      script = "hello";
      wantedBy = ["default.target"];
    };
  }
```

Nix-Maid doesn't have an auto-magic installer tool:

```
$ nix-env -if nix-maid.nix
$ activate
```

Single user installation, with flakes:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nix-maid.url = "github:viperML/nix-maid";
  };
  outputs = {self, nixpkgs, nix-maid}: let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in {
    packages.${system}.default = nix-maid pkgs {
      packages = [
        pkgs.git
      ];
      file.home.".gitconfig".text = ''
        [user]
          name=Maid
      '';
      systemd.services."example" = {
        path = [pkgs.hello];
        script = "hello";
        wantedBy = ["default.target"];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Similarly, this can be installed with:

```
$ nix profile install .
$ activate
```
